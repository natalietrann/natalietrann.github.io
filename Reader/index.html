                <p>It’s odd to think of a 1970s American paranoia thriller triggering the <a href="">gender transition</a> and filmmaking journey of a bookish gay kid from a third-world country who came of age in the post-Marcos era. But that’s how it happened for me. It didn’t happen in the Philippines, where I grew up and got a bachelor’s degree in psychology, but a few years after moving to New York City for graduate school. I spent my early teens imagining films and daydreaming plots and characters, but wasn’t convinced that filmmaking was a secure career. It was a calling, but not quite a profession. I did take a few film electives at NYU (where I studied business, not film) and enrolled in a summer course that took me to the Cannes Film Festival. For the most part, I was beside myself for having made it at twenty-three years old to New York, the city where movies that mattered were being made. As the mecca of American independent cinema, New York was always my intended destination, and I got high off its energy. Catching an arthouse film at Angelika Film Center or IFC Center between classes made for a productive day. Last Year at Marienbad, Ingmar Bergman, Pedro Almodóvar, The Marriage of Maria Braun—all these names rolled off my tongue.</p>
    
                In 2008, I came across Bree Daniels, the character played by Jane Fonda in Alan J. Pakula’s 1971 neo-noir crime thriller Klute, and Bree became a muse and a template. I was captivated by the steely intelligence, the sexual confidence, the lacerating self-awareness, self-possession, and vulnerability masquerading as cynicism—all while wrestling a Pandora’s box of demons. Above all, what spoke to me about Bree was her ambivalence—the primordial clash between warring Freudian impulses of self-destruction and preservation, chaos and order.
